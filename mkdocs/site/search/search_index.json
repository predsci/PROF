PROF is an R package (with Fortran code) designed for fitting and forecasting infectious disease incidence. The package takes in publicly-available confirmed hospital admission data, fits mechanistic models to the data, and provides short-term probabilistic forecasts. Currently, the package supports fitting and forecasting the individual and combined burden of influenza and COVID-19 at the state level. Susceptible-Infectious-Hospitalized-Recovered (SIRH) and Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Hospitalized-Recovered (SEIRH) models are employed to fit the two pathogens, and both models utilize a flexible, time-dependent transmission term. A baseline statistical model can also be used to fit and forecast each pathogen. In the case of a mechanistic compartmental fitting, once the user selects a state and either one or both viruses, the PROF fitting procedure iteratively determines the joint posterior distribution of model parameters. This joint posterior distribution is then used with the model to generate location-specific probabilistic forecasts of the near-term number of hospital admissions. If both viruses are chosen, this procedure is repeated, and the total hospital burden forecast is estimated by combining the trajectory profiles of each disease in multiple ways, including random, ordered, and semi-ordered. In the case of a baseline statistical model, the user can also select to fit (or forecast) either both pathogens or only one of them. This simple model is fast but its informative value is limited to early/late times in the season when changes in the incidence are small. The PROF computational engine is complemented with a user-friendly GUI. We recommend using the GUI in all cases, except when fitting and forecasting multiple states sequentially. Data PROF provides full support for downloading the most up-to-date daily confirmed hospital admission data for COVID-19 and influenza. Within the PROF-shiny GitHub we provide a recent data set to enable immediate use of the package. If we estimate that there is newer data we provide a download option and prompt the user to use it. The data set is provided by the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, is updated weekly on Friday, and is called: \"COVID-19 Reported Patient Impact and Hospital Capacity by State (RAW)\". For more on the data set, see here . Compartmental Models PROF uses compartmental models with a flexible, time-dependent transmission term to fit daily hospitalization data. Whereas pathogen can be fitted by either one of the models we support, however we do recommend using the SEIRH model for COVID-19 and the SIRH model for influenza. Both models include a hospitalization compartment which is split into two sub-compartments. This split ensures that the model preserves the correct generation time (T g ) and that the ratio between cumulative recovered and hospitalized individuals is determined by the infection-hospitalization-ratio (p H ). In the SIRH mode, individuals begin in the susceptible compartment. If exposed, they transition (\u03b2(t)) to the infectious compartment where there is a probability of hospitalization or recovery (p H /1-p H ) Individuals progress (1/\u03bc) from the first hospitalization compartment (H 1 ) to the second (H 2 ), and the number entering this compartment is recorded as daily incidence (and optimized, see below). The SEIRH model is similar with the only difference being the addition of the Exposed (but not yet infectious) compartment. While we recommend utilizing the SIRH model for influenza and SEIRH for COVID-19, PROF is flexible and supports the fitting of either model to either pathogen. Time-Dependent Force of Infection We use a smoothly varying two- or three-value functional form to describe the time-dependent reproduction number: R(t) = \u03b2(t)\u03b3, where \u03b2(t) is the time-dependent transmission rate is \u03b3 is the total recovery rate. $$R(t)=\\frac{1}{2}\\left( R_{0} + R_{1} + (R_{1}-R_{0})tanh\\left( \\frac{t-t_{0}}{L} \\right) \\right)$$ The above equation is for the case of a two-value R(t). It produces a smooth curve where at roughly time t 0 the value of R(t) transitions from R 0 to R 1 with an approximate transition time of ~2L days. For the general case of three (or more) values see Ben-Nun et al. 2022 Methodology Fitting, Forecasting, and Combined Burden with a Compartmental Mechanistic Model PROF fits each pathogen independently and sequentially. For each pathogen, we determine the joint posterior distribution of model parameters by fitting the daily confirmed hospital admission time series using an adaptive-step-size MCMC procedure. Only parameters that govern the time variation of R(t) and the probability of hospitalization are optimized and all other parameters are taken from the literature. By default, a fast Fortran code is used for the MCMC procedure. Once the fitting of one pathogen is completed, PROF proceeds to fit the second pathogen. The posterior distribution of each fit can be used to (1) Create a probabilistic plot of the fit, (2) Create a probabilistic forecast (and plot thereof) for each pathogen. The final step for PROF is providing an estimate for the forecast of the combined burden. Currently, the combined burden is estimated in two ways (1) By summing the sorted trajectories of each pathogen (implying a perfect correlation between the errors of the two forecasts), or (2) By randomly summing the trajectories (implying no correlation between the errors of the two forecasts). In the near future, we plan to offer a third alternative which is based on an error correlation procedure we are working on. Baseline Statistical Model In addition to fitting and forecasting the data with a compartmental model PROF can fit and forecast the data to a baseline statistical model. For weekly data, the median prediction of the baseline forecast is the corresponding target value observed in the previous week, and noise around the median prediction is generated using positive and negative 1-week differences (that is differences between consecutive reports) for all prior observations. The resulting sampling distribution is truncated to prevent negative values. PROF implements this model using daily data and uses it to sequentially fit or forecast the data.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#prof-a-package-for-respiratory-disease-open-source-forecasting","text":"Welcome to the documentation site for the PROF package.

This example has been configured for fitting and forecasting influenza and COVID-19 data for any of the 50 states D.C. and Puerto Rico for the 2021-22, 2022-23, or 2023-24 seasons. All available data is first downloaded and then the data for the requested location is retrieved and processed. You can fit the entire requested season or just part of it. Below we demonstrate both options. We start by opening an R or Rstudio session and loading the PROF package: > library(PROF) We then download the HHS data using the provided 'hhs_hosp_state_down' function > result = hhs_hosp_state_down(down_dir=\"~/Downloads\") We can check to see if the download was successful: > result$out_flag The above should be zero. We now select a state and a season > state = \"CA\" > season = 2023 and extract the data: > prof_data = hhs_2_PROF(hhs_path=result$download_path, season = season, state=state) You can select other states or any of the two previous seasons (2021 and 2022). The 'prof_data' data structure should now be available and the data can be plotted to the screen: > plot_prof_data(prof_data = prof_data) Plots can also be saved to a file using: > plot_prof_data(prof_data = prof_data, filename = '/path/to/filename') Next we will add 'fit data' structure to each pathogen - this is the data that will be fitted using a mechanistic compartmental model. NULL values for start/end dates mean set to start/end of the season data, and fit all available data: prof_data = hhs_set_fitdates(prof_data=prof_data, fit_start=NULL, fit_end=NULL) To fit only part of the data use for example: prof_data = hhs_set_fitdates(prof_data=prof_data, fit_start=NULL, fit_end=\"2023-10-28\") You can also change the start date of the fit for each pathogen, for example: prof_data = hhs_set_fitdates(prof_data=prof_data, fit_start=c(\"2023-10-01\",NULL), fit_end=\"2023-10-28\") will change the start fit for COVID-19 to October 1, 2023 but keep the start date for influenza to its default (start of the season) value. Similarly, prof_data = hhs_set_fitdates(prof_data=prof_data, fit_start=c(NULL, \"2023-10-01\"), fit_end=\"2023-10-28\") will keep the default start date for COVID-19 and change it for influenza. If you would like to fit only part of the data we recommend using the interactive plots of the data for selecting the ''fit_start' dates and 'fit_end' date. Please note that whereas each pathogen has its own 'fit_start' date, the end date for the fitting is always the same for both pathogen. Next we load the parameters for the models (for more details see the R/ex_par_list.R script): > par_list = init_par_list(diseases=c(\"covid19\", \"influenza\"), models=c(\"seirh\", \"sirh\")) The above call tells PROF that we would like to fit SEIRH/SIRH models to the COVID-19/influenza data. To fit an SEIRH model for both COVID-19 and influenza use: > par_list = init_par_list(diseases=c(\"covid19\", \"influenza\"), models=c(\"seirh\", \"seirh\")) We can now sequentially fit both pathogens using the compartmental models we selected: > fit_list <- fit_data(prof_data = prof_data, par_list = par_list) You can now sit and relax for 10-15 minutes To save the results of the fit (posterior distribution and initial state) use: > saveRDS(fit_list, filename = '/path/to/filename.rds') To plot the results of the fit to the screen use: > fit_traj <- plot_fit(prof_data = prof_data, par_list = par_list, fit_list = fit_list) The plotting routine returns a list with the following elements: fit_traj - a list for each disease containing: model fit mechanistic trajectories, dates, and reported incidence pl - a list of ggplot2 objects one for each disease for the mechanistic plots To save the plot to a file use: > fit_traj <- plot_fit(prof_data = prof_data, par_list = par_list, fit_list = fit_list, filename = '/path/to/filename') Please note that by default this routine also plots the results of fitting a baseline statistical model to the data. Early in the season this may provide a reasonable fit and forecast. To plot the results of fitting a baseline statistical mode to each pathogen use: > stat_fit_list <- plot_stat_fit(prof_data = prof_data) The above call returns a list with the following elements: stat_fit_traj - a list for each disease containing: baseline statistical fit trajectories, dates, and reported incidence pl_stat - a list of ggplot2 objects one for each disease for the statistical plots To use the posterior distributions of the fits to create individual forecasts and a combined burden forecast use: > forecast_traj <- plot_forecast(prof_data = prof_data, par_list = par_list, fit_list = fit_list) Please note that we currently provide two versions of the combined forecast: random (bottom left panel), and sorted (bottom right panel). The plotting routine returns a list with four elements ('covid19', 'influenza', 'random', and 'sorted'). Random and Sorted are the combined burden calculated with random and sorted selection of trajectories, respectively. Each element is a list with the trajectories used to create the plots, the date array and the reported incidence array. To also save the plot to a file use: > forecast_traj <- plot_forecast(prof_data = prof_data, par_list = par_list, fit_list = fit_list, filename = '/path/to/filename') PROF can also be used to fit and forecast using a fast baseline statistical model. The procedure follows the steps we have taken for the compartmental mechanistic model. First, we add 'fit-stat data' structure to each pathogen - this is the data that will be fitted using a baseline statistical model. NULL values for start/end dates mean set to start/end of the season data, and fit all available data: > prof_data = hhs_set_fitdates_stat(prof_data=prof_data, fit_start=c(NULL,NULL), fit_end=NULL) Note that here too the start date for fitting can be different for each pathogen but the end date for fitting is the same. To fit and plot the results we use: > stat_fit_list <- plot_stat_fit(prof_data = prof_data, ntarj = 2e4, filename = NULL) Here we have set the number of trajectories to 2,000 (default is 1,000). To save the plots to a file use: > stat_fit_list <- plot_stat_fit(prof_data = prof_data, ntarj = 1e4, filename = 'path/to/filename') To use the baseline statistical model to create a 28 day forward forecast and the two estimates for the combined burden use: > stat_forecast_list <- plot_stat_forecast(prof_data = prof_data, nfrcst = 28) For the combined burden of the baseline statistical model we offer the same two options (random and sorted). The statistical plotting routine returns a list with the same four elements as the one for the mechanistic forecasts For both the mechanistic and statistical options the number of forecast horizons is set by the parameter 'nfrcst' above. By default it is set to 28. The cadence (i.e., units) of this parameter are assumed to be the same as that of the incidence data. For both the mechanistic and statistical models you can fit and forecast a single pathogen. If for example you would like to only fit the 'covid19' data you should follow these steps: Load an initial guess for the parameters and set the model only for 'covid19' > par_list = init_par_list(diseases=c(\"covid19\"), models=c(\"seirh\")) Fit only the covid19 data using: > fit_list <- fit_data(prof_data = prof_data['covid19'], par_list = par_list) Plot the single pathogen fit results: > fit_traj <- plot_fit(prof_data = prof_data['covid19'], par_list = par_list, fit_list = fit_list) Use the posterior distribution of the single pathogen fit to perform and plot the forecast: > forecast_traj <- plot_forecast(prof_data = prof_data['covid19'], par_list = par_list, fit_list = fit_list) Since only one pathogen was modeled there is no estimate for a combined burden. To plot the results of fitting a baseline statistical model only to covid19 use: > stat_fit_list <- plot_stat_fit(prof_data = prof_data['covid19']) And for the forecast: > stat_forecast_list <- plot_stat_forecast(prof_data = prof_data['covid19'], nfrcst = 28) To fit and forecast only influenza use the same logic in all the calls shown above replacing 'covid19' with 'influenza' and using an 'sirh' compartmental model.","title":"PROF Command Line Example"},{"location":"example/#setup","text":"We have setup an example.R script and suggest that you give it a try if you would like to learn to use PROF without its shiny GUI.

It assumes that PROF has been successfully installed and that the PROF-shiny-app has been cloned. Opening the App We will start by opening an Rstudio session and opening the PROF shiny app. To open the app open the ui.R file downloaded when you cloned the shiny-app and click on the green Run App icon. At this stage R may install packages that are required by the shiny-app but once this is completed a shiny window will open with the landing page of the application You can continue to work in the shiny window or select to open it in a browser. The landing page provides links to all our documentation and repositories (bottom left) and is the gateway to the Incidence page. 1. Explore Incidence To proceed to the Explore Incidence Tab you can either click on the cartoon data image or click on the tab itself. Here, the two dropdown menus allow you to select a location and a season. (We support all seasons covered by the HHS dataset.) Before you make your selection please read the message about the local PROF-Shiny data file. If the message indicates that the datafile is up-to-date there is no need for any action but if it indicates that there may be newer data we recommend that you update the data file using the Download button. Once you have read the message, and acted if recommended, proceed to make you selections for a location and a season and press the Plot Incidence Data button. Two plots will appear showing daily new hospital admission for COVID-19 and Influenza (top and bottom plots, respectively). As you hover over each plot, you can inspect specific dates/values. Each plot can be saved as a png file using the camera icon and the data associated with the plots can be saved by clicking the Save Incidence Data button. To view another location and/or season make your new selections and press the Plot Incidence Data button. The current plots will be greyed-out while the new request is processed. Once you are satisfied with your selections for location and season you can proceed the Tab number 2, Fit Incidence . 2. Fit Incidence Fitting will always be done on the currently selected location and season. You can select to fit the data with a mechanistic compartmental model and/or a baseline statistical model. The latter fit is basically instantaneous whereas the mechanistic fit(s) will take 5-10 minutes (depending on the details of the fit). Mechanistic Fit In the case of a Mechanistic fit you must first decide which pathogens you want to fit. Once you click on a pathogen you are prompted to define the model. This includes selecting a compartmental model (SEIRH or SIRH), the number of values for the time-dependent force of infection (FOI) and the start date for the fit. We recommend using the SEIHR/SIRH models for COVID-19/Influenza respectively. The choice of the number of values for the FOI depends on the complexity of the time-series you are fitting. As a rule-of-thumb, we recommend using the 3-value option only if the time series exhibits more than one peak. In all other cases we recommend using the 2-value option. Note that the complexity of the time-series may depend on your selection for the start-date for the fit. By default, this date is set for both pathogens to the start of the season but you can change that. When fitting both pathogens, the start date for the fit does not need to be the same for both pathogens but the end date must be. By default the end date is set to the last date with reported data but you can modify that to an earlier date. If you do that, then at the forecasting step you will be able to compare the forecast to the observations. The Figure below shows an example of the shiny window when all the selections have been made Once you have made all your selections you can press the Mechanistic Fit to Incidence button. A message will appear indicating that the fitting has started and will take 10-15 minutes. You can follow the progress of the fitting in the console window of you Shiny session. When the fitting is complete either one or two plots will appear showing the results of the fit along with the data. We show the median, 50 and 95 confidence intervals. As in the case of the incidence plots here too you can click on the camera icon to save each plot or on the Save Plots Data button to download the plots data as a csv file. Please not that while the mechanistic fit is in progress you can not execute any other command in the Shiny app. When the fitting is complete you can proceed to either the Statistical option of to the Tab 3: ``Create Forecast''. Statistical Fit The simple baseline statistical model is designed to reproduce all the data points and create an uncertainty based on day-to-day variations in the data. Here we only ask the User to select which pathogen they would like to fit, what is the start date for each fit and what is the end date for the fit(s). Here too we support individual start dates but require the same end date. When you have made your selection press the Statistical Fit to Incidence Button and after a few seconds one or two plots will appear (based on the number of pathogens you selected to fit). As always, you can click on the camera icon to save each plot or on the Save Plots Data button to download the plots data as a csv file. 3. Forecast Incidence Forecasting will always be done on the currently selected location and season. Mechanistic Forecast The mechanistic forecast is based on the posterior distribution of the parameters coming out of the fit. This means that only pathogens that you selected for a mechanistic fit will be forecasted and the only selection you need to make now the number of days for the forecast. By default this is set to 28 days and you can move the slider to modify this. Once you made you selection press the ``Mechanistic Forecast'' button. The plots will appear after less than a minute. The top left/right plots show the forecast for COVID-19/Influenza (median, 50 and 95 confidence intervals). The bottom plot shows our estimate for the combined burden calculated either by selecting random realizations from each forecast (left panel) or by sorting the realizations (right panel). Here too, you can save the plots as a png file and download the data as a csv file. Please note that the combined burden plots will appear only if you selected to fit and forecast both pathogens. Statistical Forecast Here we use the baseline statistical model for the forecast with all other details being the same as in the Mechanistic Forecast tab.
