# NULL values for start/end dates mean set to start/end of the season data

# To plot the data to the screen and save to a file use

# to load the parameters for the models use:
# for more details see the ex_par_list.R script

par_list = init_par_list(diseases=c("covid19", "influenza"),
                          models=c("seirh", "sirh"))

# to fit both pathogens use:
# Here we use a 3-values model for the FOI for COVID19 and a 2-value for influenza
# you can now seat and relax for 10-15 minutes

fit_list <- fit_data(prof_data = prof_data, par_list = par_list, nb_vec=c(3,2))

# to save the results of the fit (posterior distribution and initial state)

saveRDS(fit_list, filename = '/path/to/filename.rds')

# to plot the results of the fit to the screen use:

plot_fit_list <- plot_fit(prof_data = prof_data, par_list = par_list, fit_list = fit_list)

# The plotting routine returns a list with the following elements
# fit_traj - a list for each disease containing: model fit mechanistic trajectories,
# dates, and reported incidence
# pl - a list of ggplot2 objects one for each disease for the mechanistic plots


# We can also fit a baseline statistical model to the data.
# We start by adding the fit-stat data structure to each pathogen - this is the data
# that will be fitted with a simple baseline statistical model

prof_data = hhs_set_fitdates_stat(prof_data=prof_data, fit_start=NULL, fit_end=NULL)

# Running and plotting the fitting of a simple statistical baseline model will only take a
# few seconds:

stat_fit_list <- plot_stat_fit(prof_data = prof_data, ntraj = 1e4, filename = NULL)

# in the above call we set the number of trajectories to 1e4 and we do not save the plots
# to a file (to save to a file set a value to the filename)
# The fitting and plotting routine returns a list with two elements:
# stat_traj - a list for each disease containing: baseline statistical trajectories,
# dates and reported incidence
# pl_stat - a list of ggplot2 objects one for each disease for the statistical plots

# To use the posterior distributions of the compartmental fits to create individual forecasts
# `nfrcst'` days forward and combined burden forecasts use:

forecast_list <- plot_forecast(prof_data = prof_data, par_list = par_list, fit_list = fit_list,
                               nfrcst = 35)

# please note that we currently provide two versions of the combined forecast:
# random (bottom left panel), and sorted (bottom right panel)

# the plotting routine returns a list with four elements ('covid19', 'influenza', 'random', and
# 'sorted'). Random and Sorted are the combined burden calculated with random and sorted
# selection of trajectories, respectively.
# Each element is a list with the trajectories used to create the plots, the date array
# and the reported incidence array
#

# to also save the plot to a file use:
#  plot_forecast(prof_data = prof_data, par_list = par_list,
# fit_list = fit_list, filename = '/path/to/filename')


# to use a baseline statistical model and create individual forecasts 35 days forward
# and combined burden forecasts use:

stat_forecast_list <- plot_stat_forecast(prof_data = prof_data, nfrcst = 35)

# For the combined burden of the baseline statistical model we offer the same two
# options (random and sorted). The statistical plotting routine returns a list with the
# same four elements as the one for the mechanistic forecasts


# If you would like to fit and forecst only a single pathogen please follow the steps below
# After loading and plotting the data set the parameter list, and model to the single pathogen
# you would like to fit and forecast ('covid19' or 'influenza'), here we chose 'covid19'

par_list = init_par_list(diseases=c("covid19"),
                         models=c("seirh"))

# perform a fit on 'covid19' onlye using an SEIRH model and three values for the FOI:

fit_list <- fit_data(prof_data = prof_data['covid19'], par_list = par_list, nb_vec=c(3))

# Plot the results of the fit to 'covid'19 data

plot_fit_list <- plot_fit(prof_data = prof_data['covid19'], par_list = par_list, fit_list = fit_list)

# Perform and plot a forecast for 'covid19' only:

forecast_list <- plot_forecast(prof_data = prof_data['covid19'], par_list = par_list, fit_list = fit_list,
                               nfrcst = 35)

# For the statistical model it is easy to fit and forecast a single pathogen:
stat_fit_list <- plot_stat_fit(prof_data = prof_data['covid19'], ntraj = 1e4, filename = NULL)

stat_forecast_list <- plot_stat_forecast(prof_data = prof_data['covid19'], nfrcst = 35)

# Add example of combining mechanistic for COVID-19 and statistical for influenza
