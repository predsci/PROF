PROF is an R package (with Fortran code) for fitting and forecasting infectious disease incidence. The package ingests publicly-available confirmed hospital admission data fits mechanistic models to the data, and provides short-term probabilistic forecasts. Currently, the package supports fitting and forecasting the individual and combined burden of influenza and COVID-19 at the state level. An S[I]2HR and SE[I]2HR models are used to fit the two pathogens and both use a flexible time-dependent transmission term. Once the User selects a state, and either one or both viruses, the PROF sequential fitting procedure determines the joint posterior distribution for the model parameters. The joint posterior distribution is then used with the model to generate location-specific probabilistic forecasts of the near-term number of hospital admissions. If both viruses are chosen, this procedure is done twice and the total hospital burden forecast is estimated by combining the trajectory profiles of each disease in multiple ways, inlcuding random, ordered, and in-between.
